# Larvae-Orientation-NeuralNet-

Disclaimer:
The base structure is not my own as parts of the project are copied (I cannot find the original code any more). This is because I was new to unity at the time, most of the relevant code is my own, with the exception being minor part of the neural net. (Things like the hexagon animator are copied, as it is purely graphical and has no academic value)

This is a neural network that models the orientation of larvae with just having knowledge of their distance from their goal. It's supposed to model nature closely and research the effect of statistical noise on the larvae's behaviour. 

This program was written by myself and @Sarkosos as part of a university research project.
